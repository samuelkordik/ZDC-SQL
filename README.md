# ZDC-SQL
SQL queries for interacting with Zoll RescueNet database data at CCEMS.

These queries must be run against a self-hosted SQL Service database with Zoll RescueNet. Note that most of the variables and filter values are custom to one specific agency, and would have to be modified.

These queries are used in the following set ups:

- With Tableau to bring in data.
- With PowerBI to bring in data and speed up cleaning process.
- Ad hoc queries run in SQL Server Management Studio for pulling specific data.
- In R code to pull in data for processing.
